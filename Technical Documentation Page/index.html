            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
            It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
            (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
            objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
            them.
          </p>

          <p>
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
            Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
            operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
            be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
            additional objects; for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
              For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
              elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
              clicks, form input, and page navigation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
              server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
              database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
              another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
              server.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
            different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
            does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
            JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
            and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
            renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
          </p>

          <p>
            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
            declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
            number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
            values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
            more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
            provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
            for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without
            any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
            objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
            have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
            to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
            protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
            parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

          You can declare a variable in three ways:
          <p>
            With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This
            syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
          </p>
          <p>
            By simply assigning it a value. For example,
            <code>x = 42.</code> This always declares a global variable. It
            generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
            variant.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This
            syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See
            Variable scope below.
          </p>
        </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
      <header>Variables</header>
      <article>
          <p>
            When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
            global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
            current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it
            is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
            function.
          </p>

          <p>
            JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement
            scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the
            function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For
            example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the
            function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the
            block, which in this case is an if statement.
          </p>
          <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
          <p>
            This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
            ECMAScript 2015.
          </p>

          <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
            not defined</code>
          <p>
            Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
            pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
            variables using the window.variable syntax.
          </p>

          <p>
            Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window
            or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or
            frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is
            declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an
            iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
          </p>
        </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
      <header>Constants</header>
      <article>
          <p>
            You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.
            The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
            identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign
            and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
          </p>

          <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
          <p>
            A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
            while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
          </p>

          <p>
            The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block
            scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is
            assumed to represent a variable.
          </p>

          <p>
            You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
            variable in the same scope. For example:
          </p>

          <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
            WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
            //statements }</code>
          However, object attributes are not protected, so the following
          statement is executed without problems.
          <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
            "otherValue";</code>
        </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Function_declaration">
      <header>Function declaration</header>
      <article>
          A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
          statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

          <ul>
            <li>The name of the function.</li>
            <li>
              A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
              separated by commas.
            </li>
            <li>
              The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in
              curly brackets, { }.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, the following code defines a simple function named
            square:
          </p>

          <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
          <p>
            The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
            consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
            function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return
            statement specifies the value returned by the function.
          </p>
          <code>return number * number;</code>
          <p>
            Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
            value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function
            changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
            globally or in the calling function.
